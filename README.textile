h1. Rich-Support

A small package of libs providing your gem an unified interface for certain Rails 2 and 3 differences and some String class goodies

h2. Introduction

Rich-Support is a small module of E9s ("http://github.com/archan937/e9s":http://github.com/archan937/e9s) providing your own created gem an unified interface for certain Rails 2 and 3 differences.<br>It also adds a small amount of handy methods to the String class.

*Attention:* This gem does not add Rails 3 functionality to a Rails 2 application, but provides an unified interface for certain differences in implementation between Rails 2 and 3. A few examples:

* it provides a unified interface for the @after_initialize@ hook of the Rails application
* it provides the @ActiveSupport::Dependencies.autoload_paths@ to be called in both Rails 2 and 3
* it defines @String.html_safe@ if it hasn't been defined already (it only returns the String and does *NOT* HTML escapes the String)

A real world example of a Rich-Support implementation is the "Rich-CMS":https://github.com/archan937/rich_cms/tree/edge gem of which Rich-Support is extracted from.

h2. Installation

Add Rich-Support as gem dependency in your @gemspec@ file:

<pre>
  s.add_dependency "rich_support"
</pre>

Require Rich-Support in your gem (e.g. in @libs/rich_cms.rb@ for the gem Rich-CMS)

<pre>
  require "rich_support"
</pre>

Your gem is now Rails 2 and 3 compatible! Cool, huh?

h2. Using the Rails configuration after_initialize hook regardless of the major Rails version

As calling the @after_initialize@ differs in the major Rails versions, but you can just call @Rich::Support.after_initialize@ instead as it will handle things for you:

<pre>
  Rich::Support.after_initialize do
    register_assets
    copy_images
    require_models
  end
</pre>

h2. Registering your gem controllers, views and routes in Rails 2

As only Rails 3 recognizes your controllers, views and routes automatically, you will have append them in Rails 2 yourself. Fortunately with Rich::Support, you will only have to append your gem path:

<pre>
  Rich::Support.append_gem_path File.expand_path("../..", __FILE__)
</pre>

*Note*: The source file in this example is located in the @lib@ directory of the gem itself

Calling @append_gem_path@ registers the following in Rails 2:

* @controllers@ - Which is assumed to be located in @app/controllers@
* @views@ - Which is assumed to be located in @app/views@
* @routes@ - Which is assumed to be located in @config/routes.rb@

h2. A small amount of String enrichments

Rich-Support adds a small amount of methods to the @String@ class:

* @String.upcase_first@ which upcases the first character of a String and leaves the remainder alone unlike @String.capitalize@ which downcases it
* @String.upcase_first!@ only returns the upcased String when it has changed otherwise it returns a @nil@ value
* @String.copy_case@ which copies the letter casing from a passed String (e.g. @"paul".copy_case("Engel")@ returns @"Paul"@ and @"CoDe".copy_case("HERO")@ returns @"CODE"@)
* @String.copy_case!@ only returns the case copied String when it has changed otherwise it returns a @nil@ value
* @String.singularize!@ and @String.pluralize!@ which (as you expected) only returns a String when it has changed otherwise a @nil@ value
