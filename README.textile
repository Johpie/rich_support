h1. Rich-Support

A small package of libs providing your gem Rails 2 and 3 compatibility and some core class goodies

h2. Introduction

Rich-Support is a small module of E9s ("http://github.com/archan937/e9s":http://github.com/archan937/e9s) which provides Rails 2 and 3 compatibility to your own created gem.<br>It also adds a small amount of handy methods to some Ruby core classes.

h2. Installation

Add Rich-Support as gem dependency in your @gemspec@ file:

<pre>
  s.add_dependency "rich_support"
</pre>

Your gem is now Rails 2 and 3 compatible! Cool, huh?

h2. Using the Rails configuration after_initialize hook regardless of the major Rails version

As calling the @after_initialize@ differs in the major Rails versions, but you can just call @Rich::Support.after_initialize@ instead as it will handle things for you:

<pre>
  Rich::Support.after_initialize do
    register_assets
    copy_images
    require_models
  end
</pre>

h2. Registering your gem controllers, views and routes in Rails 2

As only Rails 3 recognizes your controllers, views and routes automatically, you will have append them in Rails 2 yourself. Fortunately with Rich::Support, you will only have to append your gem path:

<pre>
  Rich::Support.append_gem_path File.expand_path("../..", __FILE__)
</pre>

*Note*: The source file in this example is located in the @lib@ directory of the gem itself

Calling @append_gem_path@ registers the following in Rails 2:

* @controllers@ - Which is assumed to be located in @app/controllers@
* @views@ - Which is assumed to be located in @app/views@
* @routes@ - Which is assumed to be located in @config/routes.rb@
